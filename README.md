# üöß Python SDK - Nibiru [Archived]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is **no longer actively maintained**.

 Most developers building on Nibiru use TypeScript/JavaScript (via `@nibiruchain/nibijs`) or Go, the language Nibiru itself is built in. As a result, maintaining a separate Python client interface for transaction broadcasting is no longer productive or necessary.

For development, we recommend anything from the "[Core Tools and Language Clients](https://nibiru.fi/docs/dev/#core-tools-and-language-clients)" section of the Nibiru documentation.

The Python SDK includes a `nibiru` package allows you to index, query, and send transactions on Nibiru Chain using Python. It provides access to market data for analysis, visualization, indicator development, algorithmic trading, strategy backtesting, bot programming, and related software engineering.

The package is intended to be used by coders, developers, technically-skilled traders and  data-scientists for building trading algorithms.

## Installation
```bash
pip install nibiru  # requires Python 3.8+
```

## Usage

### Querying the chain

```python
import json
from nibiru import Network, ChainClient

client = ChainClient(Network.testnet(3))

# Query perp markets
perp_markets = client.query.perp.markets()
print(json.dumps(perp_markets, indent=4))

# Query trader's positions
trader_addr = "nibi1jle8khj3aennq24zx6g93aam9rt0fqhgyp4h52"
positions = client.query.perp.all_positions(trader=trader_addr)
print(json.dumps(positions, indent=4))
```

### Submitting transactions to the chain

To send a tx you need to authenticate using your wallet mnemonic or private key.

To create a new wallet, generate a mnemonic key using any service or using SDK call.

```python
import json
import nibiru
from nibiru import Network, ChainClient, Msg, PrivateKey

mnemonic, private_key = PrivateKey.generate()
print(mnemonic)
# Example OUTPUT:
# enlist satisfy inspire hobby romance caught great neither kitchen unfair cage awesome update fade object eagle sun ordinary again journey spell gown tiger spin

# Your wallet address
print(private_key.to_public_key().to_address().to_acc_bech32())
# Example OUTPUT:
# nibi1efsh4dq3ve58dgu68rxp8cfe4mgf89el0qfucm
```

Store your mnemonic key in a safe place and use it going forward. 

Use faucet to get some test tokens into your wallet: https://app.nibiru.fi/faucet

–°reate your chain client and authenticate with the mnemoni—Å generated

```python
mnemonic = "put your mnemonic here..."
client = ChainClient(network=Network.testnet(3))
client.authenticate(mnemonic=mnemonic)
print(client.address)
```

Check your bank balances. If the faucet succeded - your wallet should not be empty.

```python
print(client.query.get_bank_balances(client.address))
```

### Send tx

```python
output = client.tx.execute_msgs(
  Msg.perp.open_position(
    pair=pair,
    is_long=True,
    margin=10,
    leverage=2,
  ),
  wait_for_tx_resp=True,  # wait for block and get tx response
)
print(output)
```

You can broadcast any available transaction by passing its corresponding `Msg` to the `client.tx.execute_msgs` function.

## Nibiru SDK By Example

The [examples folder](examples) folder contains jupyter notebooks for a quick introduction with example to the nibiru python sdk. The goal is to teach how to query and interact with any chain (testnet, localnet, mainnet).

All the examples are available for running online in Google Colab.
